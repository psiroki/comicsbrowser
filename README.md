# comicsbrowser

A bookmarklet to extend gocomics.com functionality.

# Supported browsers

The project is aimed at desktop browsers, gocomics.com is quite bearable on mobile.
I want to keep the code clean from polyfills, the things I'm using shouldn't be
considered fancy, just use a moder browser (as you should), and you'll be fine.
